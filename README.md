# My_first_power_bi_project
This is my first power bi project on the open source data of 'Atliq hardware' data.

First step - get the data dump from online sources , I found this data dump as a good source of data to learn and play with the data where I can learn new things to work with the data and it is a real data of 'Atliq hardware' companey ,so i found it intresting to work with this data dump


Secound step- Where I performed some data transform steps in order make the data a useful one for doing some data analysis.
Transformation steps - changing header of the data tables , adding a new date table to my data , removing the null values from the transactions data as they might cause a issue ,and removing some duplicate transactions from the data and so on .,


Third step - After transforming the data into a useful one I started asking some questions that the manager wants to know from the data like.,
1. which zone give me more sale 
2. who are the top 5 customers according to the revenue (I created a revenue messure )
3. what is the proft margin for the customers
4. what is the seperate percentage contribution of each customer to the profit margin percentage ( for which i created a profit margin % messure and a profit contribution % messure )
5. what is the whole profit margin in ruppees , revenue and sales (created three messures sales,revenue,profit margin in ruppees )

There are so many intrensting insights that the sales managers of the company may be intrested in and may help him to do some steps from the insights which may help the company to grow
